<h2>
    INTRODUCTION
</h2>
<p>
    "WEDNESDAY 19 JANUARY [1763]. This was a day eagerly expected by Dempster,
    Erskine, and I, as it was fixed as the period of our gratifying a whim
    proposed by me: which was that on the first day of the new Tragedy called
    <i>Elvira's</i> being acted, we three should walk from the one end of
    London to the other, dine at Dolly's, &amp; be in the Theatre at night; &amp; as
    the Play would probably be bad, and as Mr. David Malloch, the Author, who
    has changed his name to David Mallet, Esq., was an arrant Puppy, we
    determined to exert ourselves in damning it."<a name="marker-1" href="#note-1"><small><sup>[1]</sup></small></a>
</p>
<p>
    George Dempster, aged thirty, a Scots lawyer who by putting his fortune
    under severe strain had been elected Member of Parliament for the Forfar
    and Fife burghs, was in London in his official capacity. Andrew Erskine,
    aged twenty-two, younger son of an impoverished Scots earl, was waiting in
    London till the regiment in which he held a lieutenant's commission should
    be "broke," following the Peace. James Boswell, heir to the considerable
    estate of Auchinleck in Ayrshire, also aged twenty-two, had come to London
    in the previous November in an attempt to secure a commission in the Foot
    Guards. Dempster, Erskine, and Boswell had constituted themselves a
    triumvirate of wit in Edinburgh as early as the summer of 1761, and had
    already made more than one joint appearance in print.<a name="marker-2" href="#note-2"><small><sup>[2]</sup></small></a>
</p>
<p>
    David Mallet, now in his late fifties, was also a Scotsman. "It was
    remarked of him," wrote Dr. Johnson many years later, "that he was the
    only Scot whom Scotchmen did not commend."<a name="marker-3" href="#note-3"><small><sup>[3]</sup></small></a> Scotsmen considered him a
    renegade. They felt that he had repudiated his country in changing his
    distinctively Scots name, perhaps also in learning to speak English so
    well that Johnson had never been able to catch him in a Scotch accent.
    They would have been willing to forget his humble origins if he had not
    shown that he was ashamed of them himself. But when he allowed himself to
    assume arrogant manners and to style himself "Esq." (a kind of behavior
    especially offensive to genuine men of family, like our trio), they chose
    to remember, and to remind the world, that he was the son of a tenant
    farmer (a Macgregor, at that), that as a boy he had been willing to run
    errands and to deliver legs of mutton, and that for a time in his youth he
    had held the menial post of Janitor in the High School of Edinburgh.
</p>
<p>
    It was not merely the Scots who had their knives out for Mallet. He was
    generally unpopular, apparently for adequate reasons. He had accepted a
    large sum of money from the Duchess of Marlborough to write a life of the
    Duke, of which he never penned a line, though he pretended for years that
    he was worn out by his labors in connection with it. He courted Pope,
    accepted kindnesses from him, and then attacked him after he was dead. He
    published Bolingbroke's posthumous infidelities, causing Johnson to remark
    that Bolingbroke had charged "a blunderbuss against religion and morality"
    and had "left half a crown to a beggarly Scotchman, to draw the trigger
    after his death."<a name="marker-4" href="#note-4"><small><sup>[4]</sup></small></a> His behavior towards the memory of his friend and
    collaborator Thomson was thought to be less than candid. He had written a
    discreditable party pamphlet at the instigation of the Earl of Hardwicke
    against the unfortunate Admiral Byng, and had then deserted Hardwicke for
    the Earl of Bute, who had found him a sinecure of &pound;300 a year. And even as
    early as 1763 people were saying that he was really not the author of the
    fine ballad <i>William and Margaret</i> which he had published as his own.
</p>
<p>
    Boswell, at least, had meditated an attack on Mallet before <i>Critical
    Strictures</i> was written. In the large manuscript collection of his
    verses preserved in the Bodleian Library are two scraps of an unpublished
    satire imitating Churchill's <i>Rosciad</i> (1761), to be entitled <i>The
    Turnspitiad</i>, a canine contest of which Mallet is the hero:
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>If dogg'rel rhimes have aught to do with dog,<br /></span>
<span>If kitchen smoak resembles fog,<br /></span>
<span>If changing sides from Hardwick to Lord B&mdash;t<br /></span>
<span>Can with a turnspit's turning humour suit,<br /></span>
<span>If to write verse immeasurably low,<br /></span>
<span>Which Malloch's verse does so compleatly show,<br /></span>
<span>Deserve the preference&mdash;Malloch, take the wheel,<br /></span>
<span>Nor quit it till you bring as <i>gude a Chiel</i>!<a name="marker-5" href="#note-5"><small><sup>[5]</sup></small></a><br /></span></div></div>

<p>
    And the decision to damn <i>Elvira</i> was made in advance of the
    performance, as we have seen.
</p>
<p>
    Having failed, in spite of shrill-sounding catcalls, to persuade the
    audience at Drury Lane to damn the play, our trio went to supper at the
    house of Erskine's sister, Lady Betty Macfarlane, in Leicester Street, and
    there found themselves so fertile in sallies of humour, wit, and satire on
    Mallet and his play that they determined to meet again and throw their
    sallies into order. Accordingly, they dined at Lady Betty's next day (20
    January). After dinner Erskine produced a draft of their observations
    thrown into pamphlet size, they all three corrected it, Boswell copied it
    out, and they drove immediately in Lady Betty's coach to the shop of
    William Flexney, Churchill's publisher, and persuaded him to undertake the
    publication. Next day Boswell repented of the scurrility of what they had
    written and got Dempster to go with him to retrieve the copy. Erskine at
    first was sulky, but finally consented to help revise it again. It went
    back to Flexney in a day or two, and was published on 27 January.<a name="marker-6" href="#note-6"><small><sup>[6]</sup></small></a>
</p>
<p>
    <i>Elvira</i> was essentially a translation or adaptation of Lamotte-Houdar's
    French tragedy <i>In&#232;s de Castro</i>, a piece published forty years
    before, but the English audience of 1763 saw in it a compliment to the
    King of Portugal, whose cause against Spain Great Britain had espoused
    towards the end of the Seven Years' War. The preliminaries of peace had
    already been signed, but the spirit of belligerency had not subsided; so
    that the making of the only odious person in the play (the Queen) a
    Spaniard, and having it end with a declaration of war against Spain, could
    not fail to please a patriotic audience. Since nobody reads <i>Elvira</i>
    any more, I shall venture to give an expanded version of Genest's outline
    of the plot, in order to make the comments in Critical Strictures more
    intelligible:
</p>
<p>
    Don Pedro [son of Alonzo IV, King of Portugal] and Elvira [maid of honour
    to the Queen, who is the King's second wife, and is mother of the King of
    Spain] are privately married&mdash;the King insists that his son should marry
    Almeyda [the Queen's daughter, sister to the King of Spain]&mdash;he
    acknowledges his love for Elvira&mdash;she is committed to the custody of the
    Queen&mdash;Don Pedro takes up arms to rescue Elvira&mdash;he forces his way into
    the palace&mdash;she blames him for his rashness&mdash;the King enters, and Don
    Pedro throws away his sword&mdash;Don Pedro is first confined to his apartment,
    and then condemned to death&mdash;Almeyda, who is in love with Don Pedro, does
    her utmost to save him&mdash;she prevails on the King to give Elvira an
    audience&mdash;Elvira avows her marriage, and produces her two children&mdash;the
    King pardons his son&mdash;Elvira dies, having been poisoned by the Queen&mdash;Don
    Pedro offers to kill himself, but is prevented by his father.<a name="marker-7" href="#note-7"><small><sup>[7]</sup></small></a>
</p>
<p>
    The play had a respectable run, in spite of its colliding with the
    Half-Price Riots, but contemporary accounts appear to indicate that it
    was not highly thought of by the judicious. I extract the following terse
    criticism from a letter in the <i>St. James's Chronicle</i> for 20
    January, the day after the play opened:
</p>
<div class="blockquot"><p>
  <i>A Brief Criticism on the New Tragedy of Elvira</i></p>
<p>
        Act I. Indifferent.<br />

        Act II. Something better.<br />

        Act III. MIDDLING.<br />

        Act IV. Execrable.<br />

        Act V. Very Tolerable.<br />
</p></div>
<p>
    Dempeter later regretted his share in <i>Critical Strictures</i> on the
    ground that neither he nor his collaborators could have written a tragedy
    nearly so good. <i>The Critical Review</i>, in which Mallet himself
    sometimes wrote, characterized the pamphlet as "the crude efforts of envy,
    petulance, and self-conceit." "There being thus three epithets," says
    Boswell, "we, the three authours, had a humourous contention how each
    should be appropriated."<a name="marker-8" href="#note-8"><small><sup>[8]</sup></small></a> <i>The Monthly Review</i> was hardly less
    severe. It conceived the author of <i>Critical Structures</i> to be either
    a personal enemy of Mallet's or else a bitter enemy of Mallet's country,
    prejudiced against everything Scotch. The reviewer could not but look upon
    this author "as a man of more abilities than honesty, as the want of
    candour is certainly a species of dishonesty."<a name="marker-9" href="#note-9"><small><sup>[9]</sup></small></a>
</p>
<p>
    It was natural to infer that <i>Critical Strictures</i> was motivated by
    prejudice against Scotland. It appeared in the days of Wilkes's <i>North
    Briton</i> and shortly after Charles Churchill's <i>Prophecy of
    Famine</i>, that is, at the height of the violent anti-Scotch feeling
    which the opponents of Bute (a Scotsman by birth) had stirred up and were
    exploiting in order to force him out of office. But the critics might have
    remembered that the most savage criticism of any Scot generally comes from
    other Scots who think he has not remained Scotch enough; as witness, by
    what new appears to be retributive justice, the general Scots dislike of
    Boswell himself. At any rate, the pamphlet was the production, not of one
    Englishman imbued with a hatred of all things Scots, but of three warmly
    patriotic Scotsmen.
</p>
<p>
    <i>Critical Strictures</i> is the merest of trifles, but at least three
    reasons can be given for publishing a facsimile of it. Scholars on
    occasion need to be able to read all the productions of great authors no
    matter how trifling, and this one is excessively rare; so rare, indeed,
    that few of Boswell's editors have been able to get a sight of it. It
    makes a pleasant and useful footnote to <i>Boswell's London Journal,
    1762-1765</i>, a work now being widely read, or at least widely circulated.
    And it contains a remark or two that should be of interest to historians
    of English drama in the middle of the eighteenth century.
</p>

    Mr. C. Beecher Hogan has given me expert assistance in writing two of the
    notes.

    We have followed the Authority of Sir <i>David Dalrymple</i>, and Mr.
    <i>Samuel Johnson</i>, in the Orthography of Mr. <i>Malloch</i>'s Name; as
    we imagine the Decision of these Gentlemen will have more weight in the
    World of Letters, than even that of the said Mr. <i>Malloch</i> himself.

<h2>
    CRITICAL
    STRICTURES, &amp;c.
</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    In our Strictures on the Tragedy of <i>Elvira</i>, we shall not hasten
    all at once into the midst of Things, according to the Rules of Epic
    Poetry; Heroic Poems and Remarks on New Plays, are things so essentially
    different, that they ought not to be written by the same Rules. Had Mr.
    <i>Malloch</i> been aware of these Distinctions in writing, which surely
    are not very nice, he probably would have discovered that Scenes admirably
    adapted for forming a Burlesque Tragedy, would never succeed in forming a
    serious Drama. In the Prologue the Author informs us, that the
    Preliminaries of Peace are signed, and the War now over and he humbly
    hopes, as we have spared the <i>French</i>, we will spare his Tragedy. But
    as the Principles of Restitution seem at present strong in this Nation,
    before we extend our Mercy to him, we insist that in imitation of his
    Superiors, he shall restore every thing valuable he has plunder'd from the
    <i>French</i> during the Course of his sad and tedious Composition.
</p>
<p>
    In the first Scene of this Tragedy a Gentleman who has been abroad, during
    the Wars, requests his Friend to acquaint him with what has past at Court
    in the time of his Absence. We were equally surprized and delighted with
    this new Method of informing the Spectators of the Transactions prior to
    the Commencement of the Play; nothing can be more natural, for we imagine
    the Art of conveying Letters by Post was at that time undiscovered. We
    must indeed acknowledge, that during the time of the Roman Empire Letters
    were transmitted with the utmost Celerity from one Part to another of
    those immense Dominions; but we also know, that after the Subversion of
    that State by the Incursions of the <i>Goths</i> and <i>Vandals</i>, the
    first Act of Cruelty committed by these Barbarians was murdering all the
    Post-Boys in cold Blood: In like manner as our inhuman <i>Edward</i> upon
    his compleating the Conquest of <i>Wales</i> ordered all the Bards to be
    put to Death, amongst the Number of which had Mr. <i>Malloch</i> been
    included we had not now been tortured with his execrable Tragedy. Novelty
    of the same kind with this we have mentioned runs thro' the whole Play,
    almost every Scene being an Interview and a <i>t&#234;te a t&#234;te</i>. The King
    wants to see his Son, the Queen wants to see <i>Elvira</i>, <i>Elvira</i>
    wants to see the King, and so on thro' the Five Acts.
</p>
<p>
    No new Thoughts or Sentiments are to be found in this Performance, we meet
    only with old ones absurdly expressed. <i>Dryden</i> said that <i>Ben
    Johnson</i> was every where to be traced in the Snow of the Ancients. We
    may say that <i>Malloch</i> is every where to be traced in the Puddle of
    the Moderns. Instead of selecting the Beauties, he has pick'd out whatever
    is despicable in <i>Shakespeare</i>, <i>Otway</i>, <i>Dryden</i>, and <i>Rowe</i>,
    like a Pick-Pocket who dives for Handkerchiefs, not for Gold; and
    contents himself with what he finds in our Great Coat Pocket, without
    attempting our Watch or your Purse. Tho' Mr. <i>Malloch</i> may only mean
    to borrow, yet as he possesses no Fund of Original Genius from whence he
    can pay his Debts, borrowing, we are afraid is an inadequate Expression,
    the harsher one of stealing we must therefore, tho' reluctantly,
    substitute in its room. In the Prologue he acknowledges himself a Culprit,
    but as the Loss of what he has pilfered is insignificant to the Owners, we
    shall bring him in guilty only of Petty Larcenary: We believe he has been
    driven, like poor People in this severe Weather by dire Necessity, to such
    dishonest Shifts.
</p>
<p>
    In this Play the Author has introduced a Rebellion unparalleled in any
    History, Ancient or Modern. He raises his Rebellions as a skilful Gardener
    does his Mushrooms, in a Moment; and like an artful Nurse, he lulls in a
    Moment the fretful Child asleep. The Prince enters an Appartment of the
    Palace with a drawn Sword; this forms the Rebellion. The King enters the
    same Appartment without a drawn Sword. This quashes the Rebellion. How to
    credit this Story, or to pardon this poetical Licence, we are greatly at a
    Loss; for we know in the Year 1745 three thousand Mountaineers actually
    appeared at <i>Derby</i>. <i>Cataline</i>, we are credibly informed, had a
    Gang of at least a Dozen stout Fellows; and it is pretty certain that
    <i>Bedemar</i>, when going to inslave <i>Venice</i>, had provided Pistols
    and Battle Powder for more than fifteen fighting Men. We are almost
    tempted to think, that Mr. <i>Malloch</i> gets his Rebellions ready made,
    like his <i>Scotch</i> Tobacco, cut and dry, at the Sign of the Valiant
    Highlander.
</p>
<p>
    Our great Author possesses, in its utmost Perfection, the happy Art of
    uniting rival Ladies, and of setting at Variance a virtuous Father and
    Son. How intimate his Acquaintance with Human Nature! How deep his
    Knowledge of the Passions! No less exquisite and refined in his Morality,
    like a true Disciple of Lord <i>Bolingbroke</i>, he unites Vice and Virtue
    most lovingly together; witness this memorable Line of the King's,
    addressed to <i>Elvira</i>;
</p>
<div class="blockquot"><p>
    <i>'Midst all your Guilt I must admire your Virtue.</i>
</p></div>
<p>
    Let us invert this Line,
</p>
<div class="blockquot"><p>
    'Midst all your Virtue I must abhor your Guilt.
</p></div>
<p>
    Let us parody it;
</p>
<div class="blockquot"><p>
    O Mr. <i>David Malloch</i>! 'midst all your Dullness I must admire
        your Genius.
</p></div>
<p>
    We heard it once asserted by <i>David Hume</i>, Esq;<a name="marker-b" href="#note-b"><small><sup>[B]</sup></small></a> that Mr.
    <i>Malloch</i> was destitute of the Pathetic. In this Observation however
    we beg leave to differ with him. In the fourth Act the whole Board of
    Portuguese Privy Counsellors are melted into Tears. The Trial of the
    Prince moves the Hearts of those Monsters of Iniquity, those Members of
    Inquisition, when the less humane Audience are in Danger, from the
    Tediousness of two insipid Harangues of falling fast asleep. This majestic
    Scene is too exactly copied from a Trial at the <i>Old Bailey</i>, to have
    even the Merit of Originality. And indeed it is to the Lenity of the King
    of <i>Portugal</i> that we owe by far the greater Part of this amazing
    Play. The good Man lets his rebellious Subjects out of Prison to chat with
    him, when a wiser Monarch would have kept them close confined in
    <i>Newgate</i>. The incomparable Action of that universal Genius Mr.
    <i>Garrick</i> alone, saved this Act from the Damnation it deserved. Had
    not he, like a second <i>&AElig;neas</i>, carried the old doating and decrepid
    Father on his Back, he must have lain by the Way. Tho' we must observe
    another Character in this Play seemed better suited to the Impetuosity and
    Fire of this Actor. We could not but smile at the Humour of a merry Wag in
    the Pit, who at the Conclusion of one of the most tiresome Pleadings, with
    some Degree of Impatience and Emotion called out, <i>Encore, encore</i>.
</p>
<p>
    In the fifth Act we were melted with the Sight of two young Children which
    the King embraced, which the Prince embraced, which <i>Elvira</i>
    embraced. Mr. <i>Addison</i> in the 44th No. of the <i>Spectator</i>, has
    some Remarks so judicious and lively on the Practice of introducing
    Children on the Stage, that we must beg leave to transcribe the Passage.
</p>
<p>
    "A disconsolate Mother with a Child in her Hand, has frequently drawn
    Compassion from the Audience, and has therefore gained a Place in several
    Tragedies; a modern Writer who observed how this had taken in other Plays,
    being resolved to double the Distress, and melt his Audience twice as much
    as those before him had done, brought a Princess on the Stage with a
    little Boy in one Hand, and a Girl in the other. A third Poet being
    resolved to out-write all his Predecessors, a few Years ago introduced
    three Children with great Success; and as I am informed a young Gentleman
    who is fully determined to break the most obdurate Heart, has a Tragedy by
    him where the first Person that appears on the Stage is an afflicted
    Widow, in her mourning Weeds, with half a dozen fatherless Children
    attending her, like those that usually hang about the Figure of Charity.
    Thus several Incidents that are beautiful in a good Writer become
    ridiculous by falling into the Hands of a bad one."
</p>
<p>
    We would suggest to Mr. <i>Malloch</i> the useful Hint of introducing in
    some of his future Productions, the whole Foundling Hospital, which with a
    well painted Scene of the Edifice itself would certainly call forth the
    warmest Tears of Pity, and the bitterest Emotions of Distress; especially
    when we consider that many of the Parents of these unfortunate Babes would
    probably be Spectators of this interesting Scene.
</p>
<p>
    The Conclusion of the Piece is as abrupt as the other Parts of it are
    absurd. We should be much at a Loss to guess by whom the Poison is
    administered to <i>Elvira</i>, were we not aided in our Conjectures by the
    shrewd Suspicions which the King, tho' otherwise a very loving Husband,
    seems to entertain of his Wife. Upon my regreting that her Majesty, if
    guilty, should escape without poetical Justice at least, a Gentleman who
    sat behind me, a Friend as I supposed of the Author, assured me her
    Punishment was reserved for the Farce, which for that Purpose was,
    contrary to Custom, added to the Play.<a name="marker-c" href="#note-c"><small><sup>[C]</sup></small></a>
</p>
<p>
    Though in general this Tragedy is colder than the most extreme Parts of
    <i>Nova Zembla</i>,<a name="marker-d" href="#note-d"><small><sup>[D]</sup></small></a> yet we now and then feel a Warmth, but it is such a
    Warmth or Glow rather, as is sometimes produced by the Handling of Snow.
</p>
<p>
    Bad as this Play is, yet will the Author have the Profits of his Three
    Nights: Few on the First Night having either Taste or Spirit to express
    their Disapprobation. Like the Rascals who plundered <i>Lisbon</i> after
    the Earthquake, Mr. <i>David Malloch</i> will extract Guineas out of
    Rubbish.
</p>
<p>
    We shall now give, in a few Words, the Quintessence of this Play. Monarchs
    ought to be just. Heroes are bad Men. Husbands ought to die for their
    Wives, Wives for their Husbands. We ought to govern our Passions. And the
    Sun shines on all alike. A few of these new Remarks form the Sum total of
    this contemptible Piece.
</p>
<p>
    After the Play we were entertained with an Epilogue fraught with Humour,
    and spoken with Spirit. There was a Simile of a Bundle of Twigs formed
    into a Rod, which seemed to convey a delicate Allusion to Mr.
    <i>Malloch</i>'s original Profession,<a name="marker-e" href="#note-e"><small><sup>[E]</sup></small></a> and some of the Lines contained an
    exquisite and severe Criticism on the Play itself.
</p>
<p>
    Amidst all the harshness inspired by a real Feeling of the Dulness of the
    Composition itself, it would be unjust not to bestow the highest Applause
    on the principal Performers, by the Energy of whose Action even Dulness
    was sometimes rendered respectable. We were sorry to find such great
    Talents so very ill employed. The melting Tones of a <i>Cibber</i> should
    make every Eye stream with Tears. <i>Pritchard</i> should always elevate.
    <i>Garrick</i> give Strength and Majesty to the Scene. Let us soften at
    the keen Distress of a <i>Belvidera</i>; let our Souls rise with the
    Dignity of an <i>Elizabeth</i>; let us tremble at the wild Madness of a
    <i>Lear</i>;<a name="marker-f" href="#note-f"><small><sup>[F]</sup></small></a> but let us not Yawn at the Stupidity of uninteresting
    Characters.

    NOTES ON <i>CRITICAL STRICTURES</i>
</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a name="note-a"></a><a href="#marker-a"><span class="label">[A]</span></a>
    (P. 5) Advertisement. Johnson's dictum first appeared in the abridgment of
    his dictionary, 1756, under <i>Alias</i>, which he defined as "A Latin
    word signifying otherwise; as Mallet <i>alias</i> Mallock; that is,
    <i>otherwise</i> Mallock." In four places in his <i>Memorials and Letters
    Relating to the History of Britain in the Reign of James the First</i>
    (1762) Dalrymple had given Mallet "his real name"; he had repented after
    the sheets were printed and had inserted a corrigendum, "For Malloch, r.
    Mallet," which only made matters worse. See <i>The Yale Edition of Horace
    Walpole's Correspondence</i>, iv. 78 <i>n.</i> 17. Dalrymple chided the
    authors of <i>Critical Strictures</i> gently for using his name, and said
    he was sorry for having thus yielded to a private pique (LJ, p. 190
    <i>n.</i> 6). But the matter remained of interest to him, for as late as
    1783 he sent Johnson a copy of one of Mallet's earliest productions, the
    title-page of which bore the name in its original spelling (<i>Life</i>,
    iv. 216-217; see also <i>Private Papers of James Boswell ... in the
    Collection of ... R.H. Isham</i>, ed. Geoffrey Scott and F.A. Pottle, 18
    vols., Privately Printed, 1928-1934, xv. 208).
</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="note-b"></a><a href="#marker-b"><span class="label">[B]</span></a>
    (P. 15) "We heard it once asserted by <i>David Hume</i>, Esq." On 4
    November 1762, in Hume's house in James's Court, Edinburgh. "Mr. Mallet
    has written bad Tragedies because he is deficient in the pathetic, and
    hence it is doubted if he is the Author of <i>William and Margaret</i>.
    Mr. Hume said he knew people who had seen it before Mallet was born.
    Erskine gave another proof, viz. that he has written <i>Edwin and
    Emma</i>, a Ballad in the same stile, not near so good." See <i>Private
    Papers</i> (as in the note preceding this), i. 126-127, or the Limited
    Edition of <i>Boswell's London Journal, 1762-1763</i>, McGraw-Hill and
    Heinemann, 1951, p. 101. Hume protested vigorously, though with good
    humor, at this breach of confidence, and Boswell wrote a flippant reply
    (LJ, pp. 206-207, 208-209).
</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="note-c"></a><a href="#marker-c"><span class="label">[C]</span></a>
    (P. 20) "... her Punishment was reserved for the Farce, which for that
    Purpose was, contrary to Custom, added to the Play." Stock plays were
    always followed by an afterpiece, but the afterpiece was in most cases
    omitted during the first run of a new play. For example, Mrs. Sheridan's
    <i>Discovery</i> opened 3 February 1763 and ran for ten nights before an
    afterpiece was added. The afterpieces presented with <i>Elvira</i> up to
    27 January were as follows: 19 January, <i>The Male Coquette</i> (Garrick);
    20 January, <i>High Life Below Stairs</i> (Townley); 21 January, <i>Old
    Maid</i> (Murphy); 22 January, <i>Catharine and Petruchio</i> (Garrick's
    adaptation of Shakespeare's <i>Taming of the Shrew</i>; 24 January, <i>High
    Life Below Stairs</i>; 26 January, <i>Catharine and Petruchio</i>; 27
    January, <i>Edgar and Emmeline</i> (Hawkesworth). But Mrs. Pritchard, who
    played the Queen in <i>Elvira</i>, seems not to have appeared in any of
    these afterpieces, and no one of them contains a queen (Dougald MacMillan,
    <i>Drury Lane Calendar</i>, 1747-1776, Clarendon Press, 1938, pp. 94, 217,
    239, 260, 282, 297). Furthermore, if the jest could be understood only
    with reference to a particular farce, that farce would surely have been
    named. This is no doubt a case where less is meant than meets the ear.
    The authors are merely saying that Mallet's play is badly constructed,
    and is so ridiculous generally that no one will know when the tragedy
    ends and the farce begins.
</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="note-d"></a><a href="#marker-d"><span class="label">[D]</span></a>
    (P. 21) "Though in general this Tragedy is colder than the most extreme
    Parts of <i>Nova Zembla</i> ..." This is perhaps the only passage in
    <i>Critical Strictures</i> that can be attributed with certainty to one of
    the three authors. The remark is Dempster's, and had been made some time
    before Elvira was presented; in fact, he had applied it originally to
    Johnson's <i>Irene</i>. See LJ, pp. 69, 306.
</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="note-e"></a><a href="#marker-e"><span class="label">[E]</span></a>
    (P. 22) "... a Simile of a Bundle of Twigs formed into a Rod ... Mr.
    <i>Malloch</i>'s original Profession ..." Garrick's epilogue to
    <i>Elvira</i> contains the following lines:
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
    <span>A single critick will not frown, look big,<br /></span>
    <span>Harmless and pliant as a single twig,<br /></span>
    <span>But crouded <i>here</i> they change, and 'tis not odd,<br /></span>
    <span>For twigs when bundled up, become a rod.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
    One of Mallet's duties, when he was janitor of the High School of
    Edinburgh, had been to assist in the floggings, either by applying the
    instrument of punishment himself (see LJ, p. 209) or by lifting the boys
    up on his back at the command of <i>tollatur</i> and exposing the proper
    portion of their anatomy to the master's birch (John Ramsay, <i>Scotland
    and Scotsmen in the Eighteenth Century</i>, Blackwood, Edinburgh and
    London, 1888, i. 24 <i>n</i>.)
</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="note-f"></a><a href="#marker-f"><span class="label">[F]</span></a>
    (Pp. 23-24) "... keen Distress of a <i>Belvidera</i>,... Dignity of an
    <i>Elizabeth</i>;... wild Madness of a <i>Lear</i>." The authors are listing
    what they conceive to be the most impressive tragic roles of Mrs. Cibber,
    Mrs. Pritchard, and Garrick, who played respectively Elvira, the Queen,
    and the King in <i>Elvira</i>. Belvidera in Otway's <i>Venice Preserved</i>
    was by all accounts one of Mrs. Cibber's best parts. It had been
    assigned to her in the majority of the Drury Lane performances since 1747,
    and she had appeared in it as recently as 16 November 1762. Mrs. Pritchard
    had played Queen Elizabeth in all the Drury Lane performances (1755-1760)
    of <i>The Earl of Essex</i> by Henry Jones and of the play of the same
    name by Henry Brooke (1761-), but had appeared in neither role more
    recently than 30 December 1761. A role of Elizabeth which she had
    presented more recently (18 December 1762) and had been appearing
    regularly in since 1748 was the Queen Elizabeth of Shakespeare's
    <i>Richard III</i> as altered by Cibber. It is probably this last named
    Elizabeth that the authors of <i>Critical Strictures</i> had in mind. The
    choice is unusual, critics generally having considered Lady Macbeth to be
    her finest tragic role. Garrick had played Lear on 31 December 1762
    (<i>Drury Lane Calendar</i>, as above, pp. 237-238, 268, 313-315, 338).

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     https://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
